# Implementing Horizontal Scaling in Node.js and TypeScript

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of horizontal scaling in a Node.js application using TypeScript. Horizontal scaling, also known as scaling out, involves adding more machines or instances to handle the increased load rather than upgrading the existing hardware. In this project, we explore strategies and techniques to horizontally scale a Node.js application efficiently.

## Technologies Used

-   Node.js
-   TypeScript
-   Express.js

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

 - **Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/sumitnair26/horizontal-scaling-NodeJS

 - **Install dependencies:**

    cd horizontal-scaling-NodeJS
    npm install

 - **Run the application:**

    tsc -b
    node index.js
